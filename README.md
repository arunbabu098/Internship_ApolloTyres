# Data-Driven Internship Project at Apollo Tyres: Optimizing the HP2 Tyre Machine</h1>

## Overview
<p>This internship project at Apollo Tyres focused on enhancing productivity by reducing defects in the HP2 Classic Tyre Building Machine. My role was to analyze data and derive actionable insights that could lead to significant process improvements within the manufacturing unit.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The main objective was to identify and mitigate the root causes of defects in the HP2 machine, thereby enhancing the overall productivity and efficiency of the tyre production line.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Data:</strong> Collected through direct observations and real-time data logging on the HP2 machine. Surveys were conducted among floor managers and operators to gain insights into operational challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Data:</strong> Analyzed historical performance data from company logs to track defect trends and machine efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tools Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Utilized SPSS and Excel for data processing and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Lean Manufacturing Techniques:</strong> Applied DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) framework to structure the improvement process.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Defects and Maintenance:</strong> Identified key defects like off-centered beads and wrinkles, primarily due to worn components and inadequate maintenance schedules.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Bottlenecks:</strong> Manual handling and outdated equipment, such as jig cranes, were reducing operational efficiency and increasing downtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent Training:</strong> Variability in machine operation across different shifts highlighted the need for standardized training to ensure uniformity in production quality.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Preventive Maintenance:</strong> Implement a rigorous maintenance routine with scheduled checks and timely replacements to reduce breakdowns and enhance machine longevity.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation and Workflow Optimization:</strong> Introduce automated material handling systems and update workflows to eliminate bottlenecks and improve operational speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Standardized Training Program:</strong> Establish comprehensive training for all operators to ensure consistency and accuracy in machine handling and maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Robust Quality Controls:</strong> Set up stringent quality checkpoints before and after production to detect and address defects early.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Lean Practices:</strong> Adopt 5S and other lean methodologies to streamline operations and maintain a high standard of workplace organization and efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Data Monitoring:</strong> Deploy a dashboard for real-time monitoring of machine performance to facilitate immediate adjustments and proactive maintenance.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This internship provided a deep dive into the intricacies of manufacturing optimization at Apollo Tyres, enhancing my analytical skills and preparing me for a data-driven career in industrial optimization. The recommended improvements have the potential to significantly boost productivity and reduce waste, showcasing the value of data analysis in manufacturing processes.</p>
